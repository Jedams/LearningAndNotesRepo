            Pulling Pushing and other things
    Overview of a problem
        Initially we used git init on a local folder to initilise  repo - we seperately created a 
        a github repo at a later date and tried to merge
        the two repos. This had an error that we could not 
        update repos with unrelated histories. 
        This was resolved with using
        git checkout <onlineMain>
        git merge <localMaster> --allow-unrelated-histories
git pull 
    a combination of Fetch (from origin URL) and merge
    updates working directory and syncs with origin
git push origin
    push working directory files to origin





git branch
      lists branches
git branch <Name>
    creates a new branch with Name

git switch <BranchName>
    Move to the <BranchName>
git switch -c <Name> <TagName>
    C(c)reates a branch ith <Name> copying <TagName>
git tag -l 
    Lists tags in* Current branch???*
git branch -r 
    Lists remote branch

            ||Creating Folder and INITINGIT||

cd <Parent folder name>
mkdir <$repositoryName>
cd <$repositoryName>
git init 
        This will create  folder and the create
         a local git repository in that folder
